This repository facilitates sharing online resources for Micronesian entomology.

## [UOG Insect Collection Database](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=180)

**Description:** The University of Guam insect collection uses SCAN ([Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network](https://scan-bugs.org/portal/index.php)) as an online catalogue. SCAN was selected because it is totally web based and [it automatically pushes data to GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/56e311e3-43c6-4b99-aa21-af396074d5e3).

**Suggested improvement:** The database would be greatly enhanced by adding digital images of the specimens. I suggest starting by imaging a single specimen for each identified species.

## [List of Insects and Mites Attacking Crops in Micronesia](https://aubreymoore.github.io/crop-pest-list/)

**Description:** This list was originally compiled by Dr. Don Nafus and Dr. Ilse Schreiner, former entomologists at the University of Guam. With permission from the authors, I put this online in the late 1990s while working at Northern Marianas College (NMC).

**Suggested improvement:** The list is badly in need of updating following recent arrival of new pests in Micronesia, geographical range expansions within the region and name changes. Addition of links to fact sheets, pests images, damage symptom images, and available control methods would be a big improvement.

## [iNaturalist Project: Insects of Micronesia](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/insects-of-micronesia)

**Description:** I started this project in 2014 to facilitate identification of insects from digital photographs taken within Micronesia by clients. iNat quickly became a major tool for me:
* to document insects observed/collected during field visits
* to document spread of recently discovered invasive species
* as a teaching tool. My students used iNat to catalog their collections and to learn about insect taxonomy.

**Suggested improvement:** Always wanted to put on a public workshop on using iNaturalist and to organize a bioblitz but never got around to this.

## [General Entomology Course Website](https://aubreymoore.github.io/ALBI-345/)

**Description:** I developed and maintained this class website for free using GitHub Pages.

**Suggested improvement:** In recent years, UOG has encouraged instructors to use Moodle, which may be preferable. Moving content should be easy.
